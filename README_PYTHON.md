- Verify the Ollama URL in settings

**Voice recognition not working**
- Check microphone permissions
- Adjust microphone sensitivity in settings
- Ensure internet connection for Google speech recognition

**TTS not working**
- Install audio drivers
- Check system volume settings
- Try different TTS engines in the code

## üîß Development

### Adding New Commands
Extend the `execute_command` method in the `JarvisAI` class:

```python
elif command.startswith("your_command"):
    # Your command logic here
    return True, "Success message"
```

### Customizing the GUI
Modify the `setup_*_tab` methods in the `JarvisGUI` class to add new interface elements.

### Adding New AI Models
Update the model selection in the settings tab and ensure the model is available in Ollama.
